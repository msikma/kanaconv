bugs:
- small kana are considered to be "not pure vowels". doesn't affect anything
though.

- occasionally there are words that have a katakana small tsu in front of a
hiragana character. these probably aren't picked up on right now. this needs
a test case.


remember to add the small vowels to the regex!!!
メロディー = merodī


ALSO:
[ ] The capital characters ĀĪŪĒŌ are unused. (Note in readme)
[ ] test weird edge cases
[ ] change all examples to katakana in comments/docstr
[ ] add ヮゎ
[ ] test with 3.4

add the ability to get 'integrated' kana+romaji, eg.

がっこう = が(ga)っこう(kkō)
セーラー = セー(sē)ラー(rā)

and add ability to supply a custom replacement string

RULES TO IMPLEMENT:

the last 'uu' is never converted to ū if it's the end of a string

implement the word border, e.g.
ぬれ|えん = nureen
おねえさん = onēsan
こ|おどり = koodori
こおり = kōri
食う = kuu

we can generate these word borders by getting a kanji + kana version of a word.

The combination o + u is written ou if a word-border exists between them or it is the end part of terminal form of a verb:
まよ|う = mayou
こ|うま = kouma
がっこう = gakkō
とうきょう = tōkyō

The long vowels within loanwords are indicated by macrons (ā, ī, ū, ē, ō) as follows:
セーラー = sērā
パーティー = pātī
ヒーター = hītā
レーナ = rēna
タクシー = takushī
スーパーマン = sūpāman


n before labial consonants = 'n\'' before vowels and y, e.g.
ぐんま = gunma
かんい = kan'i
しんよう = shin'yō

special case: っち:
こっち = kotchi, NOT kocchi
まっちゃ = matcha, NOT maccha
みっつ = mittsu


also:
When he へ is used as a particle, it is written e.
When wo を is used as a particle, it is written o.
probably irrelevant as we don't have the information on what a particle is.
